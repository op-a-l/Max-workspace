#### Hi, 
I made and maintain this repository to share my music related Max things. 

##### How is it made ?

In this repo, you'll find pathches organized in a simple fashion. 
- If you are looking for music apps and are not that much into programming, you'll find cool things in the **/apps** folder.
- If you'd like to build your very own music app, you might like to use the patches in the **/modules** folder.
- Some nice instruments can be found in the **/instruments** folder. If you wanna learn about the "protocol" these instruments work with, find the README.md file in **/instruments**.
- Some uneasily categorizable patches are stored in the **/others** folder. Sometimes, these are unfinished works, other times, these are just badly thought patches.

##### How to use my patches

Feel free to use my patches in your musical projects. I'd love to see how you incorporate them into your work! If you create something cool, don't hesitate to share it with me.
